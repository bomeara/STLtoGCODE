Description: STL files are commonly used to transmit 3D models.
    There are many tools to use to tell a 3D printer that builds up models
    how to convert that file to instructions to the machine. There is
    software to do the same for telling a machine that uses a spinning
    tool to remove material to make a model (CNC mills), but these can be
    complex (FreeCAD) and sometimes expensive (much commercial software),
    and may not work on all platforms (pycam). STLtoGCODE is a simple
    approach that converts an STL file to the basic GCODE used for
    controlling a CNC -- it has far fewer features than commercial or
    other open source tools (no custom bit shapes, no clever algorithms
    for spiral cuts, outlining) but it's a fast way to go from an STL file
    to instructions that will run on a typical small garage CNC. Note this
    works for "2.5D" objects: things that are relief (think about a model
    of the Grand Canyon or Mount Fuji, rather than a sphere) -- it's for a
    home CNC that can only remove material from the top down. All software
    may have bugs, and these can have real world impacts -- you do not
    want an automated IV pump to dispense the wrong dosage, or banking
    software to lose your deposit. This package makes code to have an
    expensive robot put a quickly spinning piece of metal into wood or
    some other hard material and drag it around. Things can go very wrong.
    Please inspect the GCODE it creates and verify that it will work for
    your machine and your set up. If you cannot verify this, you should
    not use this tool. This code may have mistakes that could lead to
    potentially catastrophic mistakes if you trust it. I am creating it
    for my own use, but I believe in the open source ethos and encourage
    competent people to improve this code.
